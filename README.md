# CogChain: Enhancing Emotional Support Conversation with Cognitive Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
We will release ESChain as soon as possible. 💪

Star this repo to receive the latest notifications. 🙌

we propose CogChain, a cognitive chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning framework that mimics a human supporter’s cognitive process for emotional support conversation. Specifically, CogChain employs a chained structure to analyze the seeker’s issues, infer internal thoughts, determine behavioral intentions, and select appropriate strategies to achieve support goals.
